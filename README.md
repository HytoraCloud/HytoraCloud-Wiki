# ðŸ”° Getting Started

Before we can jump right in installing HytoraCloud on our server, we have to go over some things.

### Prerequisites

* _**\[CRUCIAL\]**_ Java 8/11 [\(Guide here\)](install/installing-java.md)
* _**\[CRUCIAL\]**_ A compatible operaing system: either Windows, Debian 9/10 or Ubuntu 20.04, this may change in the near future
* _**\[CRUCIAL\]**_ Basic terminal knowledge \(this is basically what this whole guide depends on\)
* 2GB of RAM
* 2 \(v\)Cores

### Warnings

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you do not know how to "cd" into different directorys or connect to your server via. SSH/SFTP then this guide is most likely nothing for you.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
HytoraCloud is so-called "beta software" and may contain bugs and other issues. Please report them on our discord server or GitHub issues page.
{% endhint %}

Alright! After you met all the requirements above we can start by installing Java on our server!
