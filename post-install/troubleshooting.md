### Problem: Java not found

#### Fix

Please follow [this guide](../install/installing-java.md) in order to install Java.



### Problem: Screen not found

If this error occurs, you most likely forgot to install `screen` on your system.

Run the following command in your terminal:

```text
$ sudo apt-get install screen
```

### Problem: NullPointerException on startup

The reason for this error is that you most likely didn't read the guide + didn't follow the instructions the setup gave you and enabled auto-updater anyway. 

#### Fix

Open `local/config.json` using the editor of your choice and set `autoUpdater` to `false`.
